# EcsRx.Unity

[EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx) is a reactive take on the common ECS pattern with a well separated design, this library builds off that basis and adds unity specific helpers and functionality.

If you do not need support for Unity and just want to use [EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx) in .net projects then head on over to the [EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx) repo [https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx).

## Features

### Architecture
- Simple ECS interfaces to follow
- Fully reactive architecture
- Favours composition over inheritance
- Adheres to inversion of control
- Lightweight codebase 
- Built in support for events (raise your own and react to them)
- Built in support for pooling (easy to add your own implementation or wrap 3rd party pooling tools)
- Built in support for plugins (wrap up your own components and systems and share them with others)
- Fully testable and easy to mock

### Unity specific
- Simple unity conventions to follow (if you dont like it, easy enough to roll your own)
- Built in support for editor viewing and editing of components
- Built in support for dependency injection via Zenject (or other DI frameworks)
- Lots of extension and architectural helpers to help MonoBehaviours interact with the core framework
- Plays nicely with scene first style setups

## Examples

There are a lot of example projects within the repository which you can clone and look at if you wish, or if you want more complex examples look at:

- [ecsrx/ecsrx.roguelike2d](https://github.com/ecsrx/ecsrx.roguelike2d) (Unity Rogluelike 2d using EcsRx)

- [ecsrx/ecsrx.buffs](https://github.com/ecsrx/ecsrx.buffs) (Example EcsRx plugin)

There is also a supplementary data-binding framework [grofit/bindingsrx](https://github.com/grofit/bindingsrx) which can speed up development of UI related interactions by adding one/two way data binding on UI and other unity objects.

## Requirements

- Unity 2018 (.net 4.5)
- [UniRx 6+](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
- [Zenject 6+](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)

### HELP I DONT WANT UNITY 2018 .NET 4.5

The 1.0.0 release and above will target .net 4.5 and unity 2018, if you need to support earlier versions of unity then use the previous 0.* release stream.

## Installation

You can take the unitypackage installation file from the relevent release.

- EcsRx.Unity.unitypackage

The package contains a wrapper around the **Core** framework and some unity helpers. The core is provided as dlls which are built for release, if you want/need to access the debug versions pull down the [EcsRx/EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx) master version and build for debug and use those dlls.

## Quick Start

- Install EcsRx.Unity package
- Install Zenject
- Install UniRx 

You will ultimately need to create a `SceneContext` from *Zenject* then create an your own implementation of `EcsRxApplicationBehaviour` where you can setup your systems and entities.

Much like any other ECS implementation you have the notion of entities (`IEntity`), components (`IComponent`) and systems (`ISystem`), although there are a few types of systems which you can implement based upon your needs, check out the docs folder for more information on these subjects as its more than just a 1 liner.
